Here are the steps for solving the problem of predicting housing prices using linear regression:

    Collect and prepare the data: Gather a dataset of housing prices and various features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. Clean and preprocess the data to remove any outliers, missing values, or irrelevant features.

    Split the data into training and testing sets: Split the data into two parts, one for training the model and the other for evaluating its performance. A common split is to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

    Create a linear regression model: Define a linear regression model with the input features and the target variable (housing price). The model will learn the relationship between the features and the price by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values.

    Train the model: Train the model using the training data. During training, the model adjusts the coefficients (weights) of the linear regression equation to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.

    Evaluate the model: Evaluate the model's performance using the testing data. Calculate the MSE, root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) values to measure how well the model fits the data. Adjust the model and repeat steps 4-5 until the performance is satisfactory.

    Make predictions: Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to make predictions on new data. Provide the input features (size, location, number of bedrooms, etc.) of a new house to the model, and it will predict the price based on its learned coefficients.

    Monitor and improve: Monitor the performance of the model over time and update it with new data or features as necessary to improve its accuracy.

By following these steps, you can use linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features.
