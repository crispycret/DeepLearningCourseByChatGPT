# Step 1: Collect and prepare the data

# Load the housing data from a CSV file
data = load_data('housing.csv')

# Extract the input features (X) and target variable (y) from the data
X = data[:, :-1]  # input features
y = data[:, -1]   # target variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Preprocess the input features
X_train = preprocess_data(X_train)
X_test = preprocess_data(X_test)


# Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets

# Use a function to split the data into training and testing sets
# The 'test_size' parameter specifies the proportion of data to use for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(X, y, test_size=0.2)


# Step 3: Create a linear regression model

# Initialize a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()


# Step 4: Train the model

# Train the linear regression model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)


# Step 5: Evaluate the model

# Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing data
# Calculate mean squared error (mse), root mean squared error (rmse),
# and R-squared (r_squared) values to measure the model's fit to the data
mse, rmse, r_squared = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)


# Step 6: Make predictions

# Provide the input features of a new house to the model and
# use the trained model to predict its price
new_house = [3000, 'Seattle', 4, 2.5]  # new house features
new_house = preprocess_data(new_house)
predicted_price = model.predict(new_house)


# Step 7: Monitor and improve the model

# Continuously monitor the performance of the model and update it
# with new data or features as necessary to improve its accuracy
