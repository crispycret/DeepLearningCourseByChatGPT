Linear regression is a simple machine learning algorithm that is used to predict a continuous numerical output based on one or more input features. Here are some problems that linear regression can and cannot solve:

## Linear regression can solve:

 * Prediction of housing prices based on various features like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
 * Prediction of the sales of a product based on the price, marketing spend, and other factors.
 * Predicting the temperature of a city based on various weather factors like humidity, wind speed, etc.

## Linear regression cannot solve:

 * Classification problems, where the goal is to predict a categorical output. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not is a classification problem, not a regression problem.
 * Non-linear problems, where the relationship between the input features and the output is non-linear. For example, predicting the probability of a disease based on the age of the patient and their medical history is a non-linear problem that requires a more complex algorithm than linear regression.
 * Problems where the input features are not quantitative or continuous, such as text or image data. In such cases, other algorithms like natural language processing or computer vision techniques are more appropriate.
