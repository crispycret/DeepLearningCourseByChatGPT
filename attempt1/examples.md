"response": "Here is a list of simple deep learning examples in descending order of difficulty/complexity:

    Linear Regression: A simple machine learning algorithm where you train a model to predict a continuous numerical output based on an input feature(s). It involves finding the best fit line that minimizes the distance between the predicted values and the actual values.

    Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a categorical output (binary or multi-class) based on one or more input features.

    Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP): A simple feedforward neural network consisting of one or more hidden layers between the input and output layers. It can be used for classification and regression tasks.

    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A type of neural network used for image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. It involves applying convolutional filters to the input image to extract features and then passing those features through fully connected layers to make predictions.

    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): A type of neural network used for sequence modeling and time series analysis. It has a feedback loop that allows it to take into account previous inputs and their corresponding outputs when making predictions.

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): A type of neural network architecture used for generating new data that resembles the training data. It involves training two models - a generator and a discriminator - in a game-theoretic framework to produce realistic synthetic data.

Note that the difficulty level of these examples may vary depending on the level of expertise of the person implementing them."
